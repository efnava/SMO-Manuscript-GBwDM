This repository contains the code and data necessary to replicate the 
results of selected case studies in the manuscript entitled "A gradient boosting approach with diversity promoting measures for the ensemble of surrogates in engineering", by Queipo and Nava (2018). The name of the folders reflects the case studies under consideration. The code is available in the form of Jupyter notebooks and the data files (when necessary) are in csv format. The notebooks were created under the Anaconda environment and the software dependencies (specified at the top of the file) should be resolved using the appropriate package manager (e.g., conda, pip).
